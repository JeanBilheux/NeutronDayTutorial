# NeutronDayTutorial

# Interfaces

## Getting started with PyQt apps

- full tutorial step by step can be found [here](https://github.com/JeanBilheux/PyQtGui101/wiki)

# Jupyter notebooks

## jupyter  notebooks / conda / jupyter.sns.gov

- showing one way the users can log in and get access to their notebooks (https://github.com/JeanBilheux/IPTS_16259)

## jupyter widgets

Goal is to simplify user's life and avoir errors 

- Here we look at 2 notebooks that do the same thing but one takes advantages of the widgets, the other don't (https://github.com/JeanBilheux/NotebooksWithWithoutWidgets.git)
- List of widgets and how to use them (https://github.com/JeanBilheux/python_tutorial/tree/master/jupyter/widgets)

## jupyter for training

- video made to show the users how to use the notebooks (https://www.dropbox.com/s/7065w17czkzff5e/JupyterNotebookTutorial.mov?dl=0)

- to run pyqtgraph examples

  ```
  pip install pyqtgraph
  > python
  >>> import pyqtgraph.examples.
  >>> pyqtgraph.examples.run()
  ```
